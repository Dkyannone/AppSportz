# Sports-App
**Description**
> Being a parent and keeping track of when your son or daughter’s games are is very 
crucial for their participation on the team. With weekly emails typically being the only source of 
tournament info nowadays your inbox can become cluttered and the weekly email may be 
overlooked. There is an app on the market called Tourney Machine. This app requires the user to 
search the specific tournament their child’s team is playing on and then search the team that their 
child is on and then follow that team so they can view the schedule. This app is widely used but 
there are many flaws. One major flaw is sometimes the tournaments are not updated until the day 
of the event. Another flaw is checking on the score of a team’s game is not updated in live time, 
which means that the user must wait until the game is over and the scores are handed in which 
can take some time to attain. With this new lacrosse/hockey app a user is able to view all of these 
things in real time. The user will also be able to see all of their child’s team’s schedule ahead of 
the time of the tournament. Yes, there will be emails sent out for reminders, but if the user is 
curious about the tournament schedule for the weekend they can open the app and with one or 
two taps view the calendar to see all the times and dates. The main goal of this app is for a club 
team to relay scheduling information with its customers in a more reasonable fashion than what 
is currently available.
